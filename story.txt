Thomas the potato gets put on the chopping block. He is in the kitchen of mcdonalds.

After Thomas the potato was put onto the chopping break he cried out of fear: "Please don't cut me that would hurt!". Little balls of water began to roll down the potato's coarse sides

Thomas the potato cried sadlly and his face was blushed.  

The cook saw the beads of water rolling down Thomas's face and took mercy on the small potatoe. He threw Thomas back into the potatoe box so he could be with his family.
